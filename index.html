          <Strong>Howdy!</Strong> My name is Kassandra Gonzalez and I am an
          aspiring web developer in the San Antonio, TX area. I was first
          introduced to the world of coding during the course of my
          undergraduate years at St. Edward's Univeristy at Austin, TX. I was
          fasinated by what I was learning and knowing I had the ability to be
          creative in a way I never thought possible.

          After a few years in the field of my study, I realized I wanted, no,
          needed, a challenge. I remembered how I felt those few years ago while
          I was learning HTML, CSS and Python, although, I only scratched the
          surface, I remembered feeling inspired and challenged. I knew I had
          the passion and soul to submit myself to this journey. I am excited to
          continue learning, growing, and contributing ideas with others.
